# This is a website dedicated to the work of Andrea Traber


andrea is a bay area artist who has spent most of her life working in the field of sustainable architecture. She is a student of the Vajrayana and her main teacher is Lama Drimed Norbu. 

## This site is still under construction

All websites are, I suppose. This site is going to be an access portal and online gallery for her works. Some of her works are currently displayed on the site. The challenge I am working with is how to give it the sense of a classical gallery site but still make it a feature rich experience for the viewer, so the viewer can experience some of the dynamism that comes from her art work and the enriching quality that art itself is. 



### This site is build with React/ NodeJS/ MDB bootstrap as its main technologies.

That speaks for itself in this world. 

### If you have any adivce or cool things you would like to see, or would like to hire me to build your artsite, feel free to reach out.
